Please note that ArchUnit Examples is just the released version of
[archunit-example](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/tree/master/archunit-example). Thus a new 
example may well be added there and will automatically end up here with the next release.

If you feel it is absolutely necessary, that your example should be added to the released examples
for the current version, please refer to 
[ArchUnit's contribution guide lines](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
